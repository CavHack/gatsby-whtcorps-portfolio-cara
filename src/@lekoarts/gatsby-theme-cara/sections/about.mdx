### Who is WHTCORPS

We are a Company made up of software engineers of renown in the San Francisco Bay Area with the vision to build the world's first, opinionated, relativistic linearizable (KOPS) ecosystem; similar to BerkeleyDB and BerkeleyBSD, but expangin the Resource polymorphism of Arrow structures and still offering the batch random chunk processing of supercolumnar functors mapping millions of rows per second in Hybrid Analytical and Online Computational Streaming Software as a Service solutions. We use Prolog as our fashion ethos, with dashes of AllegroGraph and Clojure key-value stores. We wanted to fill the gaps of today's most used Databases, PostgresQL, and leverage the disk fragmentation usually avoided in RocksDB and LevelDB; instead we beat found ourselves beating them to a pulp (more on this later). At WHTCORPS we are proud to build the future of data analytics, headless artificial intelligence for backend and infrastructure-as-a-service nodes, container orchestration with latency-sensitive perceptron and orchestrated learning with compression for embedded IoT; wearable microfluidics, insulin-detection FPGA; pocket blackholes and holographic ASICS. We bring the freelist to the algebraic world and treat relationships as mappings on the Lorentzian manifold of Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Furthemore, our current RDBMS suite for enterprise contains one of the earliest adaptations of DRAM holography via cache-oblivious lockfree daggers which translate to concurrent operator overloading at the seams. Mantissas we deal with obligate our teams to achieve optimal back-envelope solutions for all Our products. WHTCORPS offer the most advanced defense oriented Post Quantum encryption schemes in signature-free and homomorphic boilerplates for all uses and needs. We're the miracle workers of low-latency streams, we've harnessed automatic failover and high-availability motifs, in globally replicated data schemnes via Automorphic Append-Log Topos within the distributed ledger for High Throughput, low latency eco-system which has laid bare several succesful blockchain companies in the valley; ours is RCU compliant software and is meant to be used in discordant sparse networks within the CAP framework of ACID PRAM systems in Distributed Data. We believe in open source development and have thus made an initial copy available for both EinsteinDB(rust) and MilevaDB(go/sql) -- our first products, and their modules of interest fidel(go-written load balancer and reverse proxy for kubernetes, docker swarm and MilevaDB), VioletaBFT(Haskell/Rust consensus layer with security provisioning at point-of-sale via Layer 7 TCP/IP), and much more...
