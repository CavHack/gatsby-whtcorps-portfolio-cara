### Who is WHTCORPS

We are a Company made up of software engineers of renown in the San Francisco Bay Area with the vision to build the world's first, opinionated, relativistic linearizable (KOPS) ecosystem; similar to BerkeleyDB and BerkeleyBSD, but expangin the Resource polymorphism of Arrow structures and still offering the batch random chunk processing of supercolumnar functors mapping millions of rows per second in Hybrid Analytical and Online Computational Streaming Software as a Service solutions. We use Prolog as our fashion ethos, with dashes of AllegroGraph and Clojure key-value stores. We wanted to fill the gaps of today's most used Databases, PostgresQL, MySQL, MariaDB; and leverage the disk fragmentation, causal+ consistency, and bootstrapping usually avoided in RocksDB and LevelDB; instead we found ourselves beating them to a pulp (more on this later). At WHTCORPS we are proud to build the future of data analytics, headless artificial intelligence for backend and infrastructure-as-a-service ghosts and DAGs; Directed Topographical container orchestration with latency-sensitive perceptron and orchestrated learning with compression for embedded IoT; wearable microfluidics, insulin-detection FPGAs; pocket blackholes and holographic ASICS.
