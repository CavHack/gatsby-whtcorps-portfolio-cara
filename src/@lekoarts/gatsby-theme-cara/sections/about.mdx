## Who is WHTCORPS

We are a Company made up of software engineers of renown in the San Francisco Bay Area with the vision to build the world's first relativistic linearizable KOPS ecosystem similar to BerkeleyDB but offering chunk processing and supercolumnar functors mapping millions of rows per second in Hybrid Analytical and Online Computational Streaming Software as a Service in Prolog fashion with a dash of AllegroGraph. We wanted to fill the gaps of today's most used Databases such as RocksDB and LevelDB; instead we beat them to a pulp. At WHTCORPS we are proud to build the future of data analytics, headless artificial intelligence for backend and infrastructure as a service, container orchestration for embedded IoT; Post Quantum encryption via Append-Log ledgers for High Throughput low latency; RCU compliant software; We believe in open source development and have thus made an initial copy available for both EinsteinDB and MilevaDB -- our first products, and their modules of interest fidel(go-written load balancer and reverse proxy for kubernetes, docker swarm and MilevaDB), VioletaBFT(Haskell/Rust consensus layer with security provisioning at point-of-sale via Layer 7 TCP/IP), and much more...
